"""Smoke and recipe-parity tests for the contributed MicroDuck ground-pick environment.

The smoke tests spawn :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, whose USD is generated
rather than committed, so they skip when that asset is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model allcollisions``.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 5. Transcribed rather than imported --
a table that read the configuration it checks would agree with itself.

Two of the integration tests are here for a reason that does not apply to any sibling. This task is
the family's most **site**-dependent, and Isaac Lab has no site concept: both mouth rewards are
measured through a fixed offset in the ``jaw_soft`` body frame rather than on upstream's
``mouth_tip`` site. That mapping is asserted twice and from two directions --
:func:`test_the_mouth_tip_pose_reproduces_the_upstream_site_kinematics` against MuJoCo's own site
kinematics on the pinned MJCF, and
:func:`test_the_head_impact_sensor_fires_when_the_mouth_reaches_the_ground` against the physical
event the channel exists to describe.
