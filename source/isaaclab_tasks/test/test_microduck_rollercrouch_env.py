"""Recipe-parity, defect-recording and smoke tests for the contributed MicroDuck crouch-glide task.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 8. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

Two of the tests here are unusual and deliberate:

* :func:`test_the_crouch_keyframe_is_recorded_as_violating_the_compiled_joint_limits` **records a
  known upstream defect** against the *compiled model* rather than against a transcribed constant.
  The crouch keyframe asks two joints for angles their stops do not allow (upstream issue draft 018),
  the port reproduces it verbatim for parity, and this test is what stops that being invisible: it
  asserts the violation is exactly the two joints and exactly the magnitude measured, so a future
  asset or pose change that removes it fails loudly and can be adopted deliberately.
* :func:`test_the_degenerate_wheel_event_survives_and_nothing_depends_on_it` is the **interlock**
  between upstream's two coupled defects (sections 13.1 and 13.3). Both halves are asserted: that
  the degenerate event is still registered, and that the per-environment friction storage it
  accidentally props up upstream exists here without it.

The simulator-backed tests skip when the generated roller USD is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.

    Upstream's BAM actuator writes per-environment friction into a *shared* MuJoCo model field that
    has to be expanded per world first, and in this environment the only thing that expands it is the
    degenerate wheel event of section 13.3 -- so removing that event breaks the actuator there. Isaac
    Lab's actuator owns per-environment storage unconditionally, which is why upstream's
    ``expand_bam_friction_fields`` has no counterpart in this port.

    This test builds the environment with the wheel event **removed** and asserts the storage is
    still per-environment and still writable, i.e. the interlock does not exist here. The companion
    unit test asserts the event is nonetheless kept.
