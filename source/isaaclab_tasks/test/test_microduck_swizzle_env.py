"""Recipe-parity and smoke tests for the contributed MicroDuck swizzle environment.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 7. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

The task is a *delta* on the roller-skating recipe, so this file tests the delta and asserts that
everything else is untouched -- the scene, the sensors, the events, the terminations and the physics
preset are compared object-for-object against
``test_microduck_rollers_env.py``'s subject rather than re-transcribed. What is transcribed here is
the reward swap, the two re-opened command clamps and the four new curricula.

The simulator-backed tests skip when the generated roller USD is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.
