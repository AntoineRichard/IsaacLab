"""Recipe-parity and smoke tests for the contributed MicroDuck roller-slope environment.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks4.md``. The expected values are spelled out rather
than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than agrees
with itself.

This task is built as a **delta on the skating recipe**, which is what upstream does too: its
factory calls the roller factory and then edits. So the tests come in two halves. The first pins
what is inherited -- the scene robot, the sensors, the action space and both observation groups --
and the *deletion list*, because upstream keeps exactly one inherited reward and a port that
silently kept a second one would still pass a term-by-term check of the nine it declares. The second
pins the slope layer: the terrain, the neutralized command, the rolling entry, the void floor and
the terrain-level ladder.

Two of the simulator-backed tests are the ones the kernel unit tests cannot cover. The rolling entry
is checked by **reading the wheel velocities back off the articulation** after a reset rather than by
asserting the write happened, and the environment origins are checked against the surface of the
terrain that was actually built.

The simulator-backed tests skip when the generated roller USD is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.

    The state written below is the shape captured from a live rollout, not a guess:
    ``artifacts/microduck/reward_nan/``. Two things are asserted, and the second is the one that
    keeps the guard honest -- the divergence must still be *detected*, only kept out of the reward.
