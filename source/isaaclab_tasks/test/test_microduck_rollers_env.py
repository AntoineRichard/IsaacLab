"""Smoke, recipe-parity and acceptance tests for the contributed MicroDuck roller-skating environment.

The smoke tests spawn :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ROLLERS_CFG`, whose USD is generated rather
than committed, so they skip when that asset is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` section 5. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

The two integration tests at the end are the **acceptance tests** for the thing that makes this task
different from every other MicroDuck task: the robot is on wheels, and the wheels have to actually
roll. A skate that does not roll would still train -- badly, and silently, since nothing in the reward
set distinguishes "the wheels are jammed" from "the policy has not found a push yet". They therefore
assert rolling directly, against a within-task control whose bearings are braked.

    A pushed robot is compared against a within-task control whose bearing friction is written up to a

    halves matter: free wheels that never turned would still train, badly and silently, because no
    reward term distinguishes jammed bearings from a policy that has not found a push yet.

    The window is 0.4 s. The robot is unactuated -- the stand pose is held open-loop -- so it topples
    within about a second, and the comparison has to finish before the topple starts moving it for
    reasons that have nothing to do with the wheels.

    Note:
        The glide margin is real but modest, and the reason is upstream's model rather than this port.
        Each wheel carries an armature of 1e-4 kg m^2 at a rolling radius of 0.015 m, an effective
