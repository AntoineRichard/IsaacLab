"""Smoke and recipe-parity tests for the contributed MicroDuck ball-kick environment.

The smoke tests spawn :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, whose USD is generated
rather than committed, so they skip when that asset is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model allcollisions``. The
ball is authored rather than converted and needs nothing generated; its own fidelity suite is
``source/isaaclab_assets/test/test_microduck_ball_asset.py``.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 6. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.
