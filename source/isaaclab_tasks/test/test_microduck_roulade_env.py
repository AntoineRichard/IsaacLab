"""Smoke, recipe-parity and acceptance tests for the contributed MicroDuck forward-roll environment.

The smoke tests spawn :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, whose USD is generated
rather than committed, so they skip when that asset is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model allcollisions``.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` section 4. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

The two integration tests at the end are the **acceptance tests** the extraction asks for
(``upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` section 7.2). Upstream's ``FULL_COLLISION`` configuration reads as
if it disabled every unnamed collider and in fact disables none, so a port that implemented it
faithfully would silently delete the three head shells -- and the failure would be almost invisible,
because the mid-roll spawn bucket is *granted* the head latch and would keep collecting the
completion-gated rewards while the standing bucket could never earn one. The tests therefore assert
the two links of that chain directly: that a head plant produces head-ground contact, and that a
standing spawn can earn the latch and open the completion gate.

       forward tucked, which is the manoeuvre the task is about; the head-ground sensor has to report
       a real force, and the latch -- head contact, head top pointing at the floor, rotation inside
       the first-quadrant window -- has to be earned by an episode that was *not* granted one.
    2. **The completion gate then opens on rotation.** Driving the rotation frontier to the gate is
       the same write ``reset_roulade_state`` performs for every mid-roll spawn, so it is the task's
       own mechanism rather than a stand-in for one; with the earned latch it opens the gate fully
       and the gated rewards start paying.

    A passive rollout cannot *complete* a roll -- coming back up off the head needs a policy, which
    is what the task trains -- so what is asserted is reachability, not completion.

    Upstream's first run found that without a support gate the optimal policy is a ballistic whip

    Two environments are spun at the same rate about the same axis and differ only in what they are
