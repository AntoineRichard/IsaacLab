"""Smoke and recipe-parity tests for the contributed MicroDuck sit-stand environment.

The smoke tests spawn :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, whose USD is generated
rather than committed, so they skip when that asset is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model allcollisions``.

compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from

a table that read the configuration it checks would agree with itself.
