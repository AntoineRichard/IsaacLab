"""Recipe-parity and acceptance tests for the contributed MicroDuck stand-up-on-skates environment.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 9. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

This task is the one in the batch with **no accuracy gate against upstream**, and the reason is not a
scheduling one: upstream's environment cannot run at the pinned commit. Three of its reward terms
index a fourteen-wide servo view with indices drawn from the eighteen-joint model layout and raise
``IndexError`` on the first reward evaluation (section 13.2, upstream issue draft 016), so there is
no upstream trajectory to compare against. What stands in its place is
:func:`test_the_rise_stack_scores_a_stand_far_above_a_fallen_start` -- an **internal acceptance**
test that spawns the robot fallen on its skates, evaluates the task's own reward stack end to end
under physics, and asserts the ordering the task exists to teach. An acceptance test that never
scores a reward would not be one.

The simulator-backed tests skip when the generated roller USD is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.
