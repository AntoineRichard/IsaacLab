"""Recipe-parity and smoke tests for the contributed MicroDuck spin trick environment.

The parity tests need neither the asset nor the simulator: they read the assembled configuration and
compare it against the upstream recipe, transcribed here from
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md`` section 10. The expected values are spelled out
rather than imported from the configuration under test, so that a drifting value fails rather than
agrees with itself.

The task is structurally the crouch-glide trick with a rate objective in place of a pose one, so the
tests that matter here are the ones that pin the *differences*: the dropped angular-momentum term,
the envelope arithmetic, the scoped neck penalty that leaves the head yaw free, and the decaying
scissor curriculum. The wheel-friction interlock the two tricks share is tested once, on the
crouch-glide task; this file asserts only that this environment carries the same degenerate event.

The simulator-backed tests skip when the generated roller USD is absent. Generate it with
``uv run --extra importers python scripts/tools/convert_microduck.py --model rollers``.
