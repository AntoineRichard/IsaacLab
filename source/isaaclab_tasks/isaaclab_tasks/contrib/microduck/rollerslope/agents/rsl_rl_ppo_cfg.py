    Upstream's runner differs from its **velocity** one in exactly two fields, so the rest is
    inherited rather than restated: the network shapes, the optimizer, the asymmetric actor-critic
    wiring and the 24-step rollout are shared across the whole family. Symmetry augmentation is off,
    as it is on every task but the forward roll.

    It derives from the velocity runner and **not** from the skating one, even though it runs the
    skating robot and the skating recipe: that class raises ``entropy_coef`` to 0.03 for the stroke,
    and upstream declares the family's 0.01 here. Deriving from it would silently triple the
    exploration noise -- and unlike the stroke, this task's positive reward pays from the first step,
    because gravity turns the wheels whether or not the policy has found anything.
