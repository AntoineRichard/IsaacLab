"""The flat-plus-ramp sub-terrain the MicroDuck roller-slope task descends.

Ported from ``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks4.md`` section 2 (upstream's
``slope_terrain.py``). The tile is three boxes laid along ``+x``: a starting platform whose surface
is at ``z = 0``, a ramp whose angle the curriculum difficulty interpolates over 2 to 20 degrees, and
a run-out platform at the ramp's foot so a robot that reaches the bottom lands on something solid.

The spawn origin is returned **on the incline**, a short way past the top of the ramp, so the
inherited origin-relative reset events place the robot on the slope and gravity starts it rolling.
That, rather than any terrain-relative height sensing, is what this task needs from its terrain: no
observation, reward or termination in the task measures height against the environment origin
(addendum section 1).

This is a task-local sub-terrain plugged into the stock generator through
:class:`~isaaclab.terrains.SubTerrainBaseCfg`; nothing in ``isaaclab.terrains`` changes.

    The ramp angle is ``deg_min + difficulty * (deg_max - deg_min)``, clamped to the difficulty
    range; its **horizontal** length is drawn once per tile from :attr:`FlatRampTerrainCfg.ramp_length_range`.
    The ramp box is rotated about ``+y`` and shifted back along ``x`` by ``(thickness / 2) * sin(angle)``,
    which places the top edge of its inclined face exactly at the end of the starting platform and its
    bottom edge exactly at the run-out -- upstream's shim, and without it the tile opens a step of up
    to 85.5 mm at the steepest angle (addendum section 2.2).

    Note:
        The draw comes from the global :mod:`numpy` random state, because Isaac Lab sub-terrain
        functions take no generator and the terrain generator seeds only its own. That is how the

    The stock default is ``False``, and this is the one field that departs from it. Two reasons, and
    the second is measured rather than stylistic:

    * The tile is **exactly** heightfield-representable. It is three boxes laid along ``+x`` whose
      top faces form a single-valued, piecewise-planar profile with no overhangs and no vertical
      risers, so the conversion the field's own docstring warns is lossy for mesh sub-terrains loses
      nothing here.
    * Raw-mesh collision does not carry this robot. On the triangle mesh the roller model's tires
      stop supporting it as soon as the wheels turn -- it rides for about 0.1 s, sinks 45 mm and
      stops -- where on the heightfield it rides like it does on an analytic ground plane. That is a
      Newton contact gap rather than a geometry error, and it is reproducible at a **zero-degree**
      ramp angle with nothing task-specific involved; see
      ``artifacts/microduck/golden_trajectories/rollerslope/controls/``. The heightfield is also the
      representation every stock Newton-validated terrain configuration uses
      (:mod:`isaaclab.terrains.config.rough`, and every ``Hf*`` sub-terrain by default).

    Conversion is all-or-nothing across a generator's sub-terrains, so a configuration that mixes
    this sub-terrain with one that leaves the flag unset silently falls back to the mesh.
