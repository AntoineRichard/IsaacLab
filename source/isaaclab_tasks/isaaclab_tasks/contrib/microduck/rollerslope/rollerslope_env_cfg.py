"""Slope-descent environment for the roller-skating Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks4.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the skating recipe live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` and are cited as "roller section N".

The robot is put on a ramp with a commanded velocity of exactly zero and asked to ride it down. It
cannot pedal -- the four wheels are undriven, as on every roller task -- so the only thing that moves
it is gravity, and the only thing it controls is whether it stays upright long enough to keep
rolling. That is the whole task, and three consequences shape the recipe:

* **The terrain is the task.** :data:`MICRODUCK_SLOPE_TERRAIN_CFG` lays ten rows of
  flat-plus-ramp-plus-runout tile, from a 2 degree slope to a 20 degree one, and returns each row's
  spawn origin **on the incline**. :attr:`CurriculumCfg.terrain_levels` is what promotes a robot that
  rode its ramp out to a steeper one.
* **Nothing measures height against the environment origin.** The skating recipe already deleted
  every sensor-backed height term the mjlab template adds, and this task then deletes every
  inherited reward but ``action_rate_l2``, so no observation, reward or termination is
  terrain-relative. The only height quantity anywhere is
  :attr:`TerminationsCfg.fell_into_void`, an **absolute world-z** guard. This is why the task needs
  correct per-environment origins rather than a terrain-height sensor, and it is what let the port
  ship without one.
* **The actor is slope-blind.** The 61-wide observation is the skating task's, unchanged: no height
  scan, no terrain sensor, no slope angle. The incline reaches the policy through
  ``projected_gravity``, ``base_ang_vel`` and proprioception only.

Like the two trick tasks, this environment is built as a delta on
:class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.velocity.rollers_env_cfg.MicroDuckVelocityRollersFlatEnvCfg`,
which is also what upstream's own factory does -- it calls the roller factory and then edits. The
edits are the whole file: the terrain, the neutralized command, the base reset's yaw, the added
rolling entry, a rebuilt reward dict, two terminations and a single curriculum term. Everything else
-- the robot, the actuators, the sensors, the action space, both observation groups and the whole
randomization suite -- is inherited, and ``test_microduck_rollerslope_env.py`` asserts that it still
is.

Warning:
    **Training this task is blocked on a backend gap, and the configuration is not the cause.** On
    Isaac Lab's generated *mesh* terrain the roller model's tires stop carrying the robot as soon as
    the wheels are turning: it rides for about 0.1 s, sinks 45 mm and stops, where the same robot in
    the same pose at the same entry speed rolls normally on the skating task's analytic ground
    plane. The accuracy gate localises it with four controls -- it reproduces at a **zero-degree**
    ramp angle, so it is not the incline; it does not reproduce on the plane, so it is not the robot;
    it does not reproduce at rest, so static contact is fine; and neither the collision margin nor
    contact reduction moves it. See ``artifacts/microduck/golden_trajectories/rollerslope/README.md``
    for the measurements. The terrain geometry itself is verified correct -- the environment origins
    are bit-identical to upstream's and a ray cast onto the built mesh lands on them to 1e-6 m -- so
    what is affected is the contact response, not this package.

Note:
    Upstream additionally sets ``nan_policy = "sanitize"`` on both observation groups, an mjlab
    ``ObservationGroupCfg`` field with no Isaac Lab equivalent (addendum sections 5.5 and 9.10). It
    guards a contact divergence upstream measures at roughly one step-environment in 25 million,
    where the free joint goes to NaN and reaches the observation one step before the ``nan_state``
    termination can recycle the episode. It is **not** rebuilt here: this family already carries the
    two halves that matter -- the NaN-guarded critic terms and :attr:`TerminationsCfg.nan_state` --
    and the residual exposure is the actor's own terms on that single step. Adding an actor-side
    sanitizer would mean touching every inherited observation term or the observation manager itself,
    which is a far wider change than the risk it removes.

    The term is **not** deleted, and that is deliberate on both sides: the 61-wide observation

    58. So the throttle range is zeroed and every environment is made a standing one, which is what
    the base term zeroes on every step.

    The descent comes from gravity, so there is nothing to command; the skating task's throttle would
    only ask the policy to pedal on a hill it is already falling down.

    Note:
        :attr:`rel_forward_envs` is zeroed here where upstream leaves the template's 0.2, and that

    The robot, the actuators, the sensors, the action space and both observation groups are the
    skating task's, which is what upstream arrives at as well: its factory takes the skating recipe
    and edits the terrain, the command, two reset events, the rewards, the terminations and the
    curriculum, and touches no observation term, no sensor, no randomization term, no actuator and no
    asset.
