"""Ground-pick environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

Bring the mouth to the floor, as close as possible **without touching**, correctly oriented; hold it
there; stand back up cleanly; rest. Then do it again. The cycle is a 4 s clock the policy is told the
phase of, so this is a scheduled gesture rather than a goal-seeking one -- there is no target to
reach and no success flag, only a segmented profile the reward stack pays for following:

===========  =====================  ==========  ===================================================
segment      phase                  duration    what the stack pays for
===========  =====================  ==========  ===================================================
descent      ``[0, 0.375)``         1.5 s       mouth low and pointing down, neck moving slowly
low dwell    ``[0.375, 0.425)``     0.2 s       the same, held
rise         ``[0.425, 0.80)``      1.5 s       legs and neck back to the stand pose, trunk vertical
standing     ``[0.80, 1.0)``        0.8 s       the same, held
===========  =====================  ==========  ===================================================

Three things follow from the task rather than from the recipe:

* The robot is :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`. The whole task is bringing the
  head assembly to within millimetres of the floor, and on the walking model the head carries no
  collider at all -- the "close but not touching" equilibrium would have nothing to push back with
  and the mouth would sink through the plane (addendum section 12.3).
* **The "without touching" is an equilibrium, not a constraint.** ``mouth_ground_proximity`` pulls
  the mouth down and ``head_impact_penalty`` charges the contact force it would arrive with; the
  hover is where the two balance. Delete either one and the task becomes a different task.
* The **payload** is physics, not reward. A 10-40 g point mass is drawn per episode and hung off the
  mouth tip from the moment the mouth closes, so the return is a lift rather than an unweighted
  extension. Upstream smuggles it in as a weight-zero reward term; see :class:`EventsCfg`.

Isaac Lab has no MJCF **site** concept, and this task is the family's most site-dependent: upstream
measures both mouth terms on the ``mouth_tip`` site. The port carries the site as a fixed offset in
its parent body's frame -- see :data:`MICRODUCK_MOUTH_TIP_OFFSET` -- which is the same adaptation the
foot terms make, with the numbers measured off the pinned MJCF rather than assumed.

    The domain-randomization suite is the velocity task's, term for term, with **two deliberate

    * The pushes are **half** the family's magnitude, +/-0.15 m/s. Upstream's note is measured: the
      gesture is quasi-static, and at +/-0.3 the robot fell over even standing straight.
    * The neck-offset randomization is **off**, because the head is the task's working end rather
      than a payload to be jittered.

    There is no ground-state reset: every episode spawns upright from :attr:`reset_base`, so the
    declaration-order coupling that governs the sit-stand and ball-kick resets does not arise here.

    :attr:`mouth_payload_force` is this task's one structural deviation from upstream, and it is
    physics rather than a reward. Upstream registers the same function as a **weight-zero reward
    term**, so that the reward manager calls it every step and it can write an external wrench
    (addendum section 13.20). This port registers it where Isaac Lab writes state, as an interval
    event on a zero-width interval -- which fires every control step, for every environment -- so
    that a later pass that prunes zero-weight rewards cannot silently delete the payload.

class RewardsCfg:
    """Reward terms for the MDP (addendum sections 5.4 and 5.5).

    Four groups, and the phase gate is what keeps them from fighting:

    * **The bend** -- ``mouth_ground_proximity`` and ``mouth_perpendicular_to_ground``, both gated on
      the descent and the low dwell.
    * **The return** -- the two ``ground_pick_return_pose`` terms and ``return_upright``, gated on
      the rise and the standing rest. Their combined weight, 16.0, is the largest block in the stack:
      upstream's experience is that the bend is easy and the clean return is not.
    * **The posture floor** -- ``feet_grounded``, ``feet_flat``, ``upright``, ``self_collisions``.
      Ungated, because a foot must not leave the ground at any phase.
    * **Regularization**, deliberately heavier than the walking task's. Upstream's note: the gesture
      is slow and precise, so strong smoothness helps transfer, unlike the dynamic stand-up recovery
      where heavy regularization blocked the motion outright.

    Two of the shapes deserve stating because they are easy to "fix" into something else:

    * ``upright`` is deliberately **weak** at 0.2 against the velocity task's 2.0. The approach
      *requires* a deep forward lean, so a strong always-on uprightness reward would price the task
      out; ``return_upright`` supplies the verticality where it is actually wanted.
    * ``mouth_perpendicular_to_ground`` can go **negative**: its kernel is a signed cosine, so a
      mouth pointing up during the descent gate is charged rather than merely unpaid.

    Two upstream slots are not carried over:

    * ``soft_landing``. Upstream restates the mjlab template's ``-1e-5``, which is a no-op; this
      port's shared base never had the term, so there is nothing to restate. It is worth naming
      because of what it demonstrates rather than what it weighs: it is gated on the *magnitude* of
      the twist command, and this task's twist is a unit vector on the circle, so an inherited
      "only while moving" gate is permanently open on any phase-command environment (addendum
      section 13.10).
    * ``mouth_payload_force``, a weight-zero reward that is really a physics hook; see
      :class:`EventsCfg`.
