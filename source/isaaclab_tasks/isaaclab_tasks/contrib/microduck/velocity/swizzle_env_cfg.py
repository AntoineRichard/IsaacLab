"""Swizzle variant of the MicroDuck roller-skating environment.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections describing the roller recipe this task starts from live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` and are cited as "addendum section N".

The *swizzle* is the beginner's skating gait: both blades stay on the ground and the legs open and
close in mirror, tracing an hourglass, so the robot goes forward without ever lifting a foot. It is
also precisely the degenerate waddle :mod:`.rollers_env_cfg` spends six reward terms suppressing --
upstream's comments there record it being rediscovered again and again. This task is that recipe
with the anti-swizzle half deleted and the symmetry paid for instead, which is why it lives next to
it rather than in a package of its own; upstream registers it in the same velocity family, as
``Mjlab-Velocity-Swizzle-MicroDuck``.

Three things change beyond the reward swap, and each re-enables a capability the stride task turned
off (section 7):

* **Locomotion becomes bidirectional.** The throttle range is symmetrized to ``+/-0.6`` and
  :attr:`RewardsCfg.wheel_speed` is told to pay for wheel spin *in the commanded direction*, so a
  negative throttle means "skate backwards" rather than "brake". The stride task's ``braking`` term
  goes with it -- to stop, the runtime commands zero and the robot coasts.
* **Turning is switched back on.** The roller command already computes a live heading error and then
  clamps it to zero; opening that clamp to ``+/-0.5`` rad is the entire mechanism (section 7.3). A
  pair of crossing curricula then hands the yaw objective over from
  :attr:`RewardsCfg.heading_hold` to :attr:`RewardsCfg.heading_tracking`.
* **The head comes under command.** The zero-padded head slot of the shared 61-wide observation is
  replaced by a real four-wide pose command, and the two terms that pull the neck back to the stand
  pose are removed or narrowed to make room (section 7.4).

The last of those has a consequence worth stating up front: narrowing :attr:`RewardsCfg.pose` to the
ten leg joints changes what that reward *is*, not only what it covers, because the kernel is a mean
over the selection. Upstream does it deliberately and this port reproduces the narrowed form
(section 13.22).
