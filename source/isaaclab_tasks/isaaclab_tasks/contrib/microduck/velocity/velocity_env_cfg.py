"""Velocity-tracking environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream checkouts.

This is the terrain-generator variant of the task; :mod:`.flat_env_cfg` derives the flat one.
Only the rough terrain itself is unvalidated: it is registered and generated, but the foot-height
rewards and observations measure heights against the environment origin rather than against the
ground under each foot, which is exact on flat terrain only.
