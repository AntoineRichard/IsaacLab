"""Roller-skating velocity environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

The robot wears skates: :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ROLLERS_CFG` replaces each foot with a
two-wheel bogie, so the two soles give way to four freely spinning tires and the model carries 18
hinges instead of 14 (addendum section 2.3). The four wheels are undriven -- the action space is the
same 14 servos as every other MicroDuck task -- so the robot cannot walk and can only get anywhere by
*pushing*, which is what makes this a different task rather than a different robot.

Three things follow from that and shape the whole recipe:

* **The surge command is a throttle, not a velocity target.** ``cmd_x`` is ``0`` to coast, positive
  to push and negative to brake, and no term tracks a commanded speed. The walking recipe's
  ``track_linear_velocity`` / ``track_angular_velocity`` are therefore deleted, and the single
  positive task reward is :attr:`RewardsCfg.wheel_speed`: the wheels have to actually turn.
* **The gait is a stroke, not a step.** Six terms shape it -- air time, glide, single support, gait
  symmetry, flat blades and forward lean -- and their common enemy is the *swizzle*, the degenerate
  both-blades-down waddle that a naive contact reward converges to. Upstream's comments record it
  being rediscovered repeatedly.
* **Turning is switched off.** The heading machinery is computed and then clamped to zero
  (addendum section 7.21), so the policy learns straight-line skating and
  :attr:`RewardsCfg.heading_hold` is what keeps it from veering.

Two upstream numbers are reproduced **verbatim although they are known to be stale**, because the
deployed skating policies were trained with them and this port's job is parity: the
:attr:`RewardsCfg.com_height_target` band and :attr:`RewardsCfg.wheel_speed`'s wheel radius. Both are
documented where they are configured.

The task is registered as a variant of the velocity family, which is where upstream registers it
(``Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck-Rollers``) and where its recipe comes from: it re-derives the mjlab
velocity template term by term rather than starting from the stand-up or roll one, and it shares this
package's joint-name, curriculum-step and PPO-runner definitions. It lives in this package for the
same reason, next to :mod:`.flat_env_cfg`, rather than in a package of its own.

and both rotations carry the site's ``z`` axis onto the ankle body's ``+y`` axis, so measuring the
body frame about this axis reproduces upstream's quantity on both feet.

Confirmed in simulation rather than only on paper: with the robot upright at the stand pose the

at the stand pose the tire centres sit 0.12573 m below ``trunk_base``, and 0.12573 + 0.0150 m of tire
radius is 0.14073 m.

Under the robot's own weight the trunk rests about 2.7 mm lower, at 0.1380 m, which is the

warns that a roller task must override it: wheels are taller than soles, and 0.125 m would bury the
tires 1.6 cm in the floor. This is that override, and it is set to upstream's band midpoint rather
than to :data:`MICRODUCK_ROLLERS_STANDING_HEIGHT` so that :attr:`EventsCfg.reset_base`'s symmetric
``+/-5 mm`` offset reproduces upstream's absolute band exactly -- Isaac Lab samples the reset height
as an offset from the configured default where upstream samples it absolutely.

The band straddles the geometric standing height, from 7.2 mm below it to 2.8 mm above, so a reset is
a millimetre-scale settle onto the tires rather than a clean placement. That is upstream's, not this
port's: it is what the deployed policies were trained from. The midpoint itself lands within 0.5 mm
of the loaded rest height of 0.1380 m.

        elsewhere as drift rather than design -- naming this task in particular, because ``wheel_vel``

        an explosion source (addendum section 7.9). See :class:`TerminationsCfg` for the matching half

    The velocity task's randomization suite with three roller-specific changes:

    * ``foot_friction`` is **deleted**. Upstream's one-line reason is that *wheels roll; ground
      friction lives in the XML* -- a rolling contact does not slip, so randomizing its friction
      randomizes nothing the policy can feel.
    * :attr:`randomize_wheel_friction` is added in its place: the bearings' MJCF friction is zero for
      trainability, and the :attr:`CurriculumCfg.wheel_friction` schedule ramps a realistic drag in
      once skating is robust.
    * :attr:`randomize_armature` **excludes the wheels**. Their armature is 1e-4 and scaling it is not
      the intended bearing model -- the friction event above is.
