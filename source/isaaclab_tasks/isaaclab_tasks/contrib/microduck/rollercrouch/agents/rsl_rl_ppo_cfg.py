    Upstream's runner differs from its velocity one in exactly two fields, so the rest is inherited
    rather than restated: the network shapes, the optimizer, the asymmetric actor-critic wiring and
    the 24-step rollout are shared across the whole family. Symmetry augmentation is off, as it is on
    every task but the forward roll.

    Note the exploration bonus is the family's 0.01 and **not** the skating task's 0.03, even though
    this task runs on the same robot: the pose reward pays from the first step, so unlike a stroke
    the trick does not have to be found before there is any gradient at all.
