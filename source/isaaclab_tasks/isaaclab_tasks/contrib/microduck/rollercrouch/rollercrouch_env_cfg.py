"""Crouch-glide trick environment for the roller-skating Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the roller recipe live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` and are cited as "addendum section N".

The trick is a *shoot-the-duck*: the robot arrives rolling, folds into a deep crouch, holds it for
two seconds while it glides on the momentum it brought, and stands back up -- four segments on a
five-second clock, run four times per twenty-second episode. The phase of that clock rides in the
three-wide twist slot of the shared 61-wide observation, exactly as the ground-pick gesture's does,
so the policy is told where in the trick it is and nothing it does can move the clock.

Two structural properties follow and shape the whole recipe:

* **The pose is the objective.** There is no height trapezoid and no velocity target: two terms score
  the fourteen servos against a phase-blended interpolation between a standing keyframe and a
  crouched one, and everything else shapes how the robot gets there. Both keyframes were read off the
  physical robot rather than designed in simulation, which is where this task's two known defects
  come from -- see :data:`MICRODUCK_CROUCH_POSE` and :data:`MICRODUCK_STAND_POSE`.
* **The momentum is an input, not an output.** :attr:`EventsCfg.reset_base` spawns the robot already
  rolling at 0.2-0.5 m/s and :attr:`RewardsCfg.forward_speed` pays for keeping it. The entry velocity
  is injected through the root reset rather than through a reset-mode push, and that is a fixed
  regression rather than a preference: a push adds to the *current* root velocity, which on a
  diverged environment sends the free joint to NaN. Upstream locks the same distinction with its own
  regression test, and its spin task restates the warning verbatim (section 8.7).

This environment is built as a delta on
:class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.velocity.rollers_env_cfg.MicroDuckVelocityRollersFlatEnvCfg`,
where upstream rebuilds it from the raw mjlab template and states the randomization suite, the
sensors and both observation groups again by hand. The extraction verified that what upstream states
again *is* the roller recipe term for term (section 8.7), so the two constructions agree in value and
differ only in how much is restated; the parity tests transcribe upstream's tables independently, so
an inherited value that drifted from upstream's would fail rather than agree with itself.

MJCF, neither is true (section 13.7): the knees are 55 and 56 degrees off HOME, the ankles 41 and 35

**KNOWN-DEFECT POSE, REPRODUCED VERBATIM (upstream issue draft 018).** Two of these targets lie
outside the compiled model's hard joint limits, measured on the pinned roller MJCF (section 13.6):

* ``neck_pitch`` at 1.0937 rad against an upper stop of 1.0472 rad -- 2.7 degrees past it, and
  0.18 rad past the *soft* bound the 0.9 limit factor imposes;
* ``right_knee`` at -1.5907 rad against a lower stop of -1.5708 rad -- 1.1 degrees past it.

Both pose rewards therefore charge a residual on those two joints that no policy can zero, so the
"hold the crouch" reward can never saturate and the policy is asked to drive two joints into their
stops with a low-stiffness servo. The magnitudes are small -- the Gaussian loses about 1.4 % and the
L1 charges a constant ``0.047/14`` per step -- so this is a transfer hazard rather than a training
blocker, which is why it is reproduced rather than clamped: the deployed policy was trained against
these targets, and re-deriving the pose in simulation is a retune with its own training run.

The pose is also **not left-right mirrored** (``|left_knee|`` 1.5248 against ``|right_knee|`` 1.5907,
``left_hip_pitch`` 1.4082 against ``|right_hip_pitch|`` 1.4757), which is what a raw capture from a
physical robot looks like.

``test_microduck_rollercrouch_env.py`` reads the *compiled model's* joint limits and records the
violation, so the defect is pinned by measurement rather than by a transcribed constant.

      phase-blended target at a Gaussian and an L1 width. The Gaussian saturates once the fold is
      roughly right and the L1 carries a constant gradient the rest of the way, which is what keeps
      a shallow crouch from being a comfortable local optimum.

      and is the only reason the fold is a glide rather than a squat. :attr:`crouch_forward_lean`

    unlike on the skating task, no curriculum ramps it. Upstream copied the event and not the
    schedule, so this environment trains on perfectly frictionless bearings for its whole run

    not a training defect, and correcting it is a retune with its own run.

    Note:
        Upstream's own ``expand_bam_friction_fields`` startup event is missing from this environment

        dead code would make upstream's BAM actuator raise at the first multi-environment step

        is kept for its own sake, and ``test_microduck_rollercrouch_env.py`` pins both halves: that
