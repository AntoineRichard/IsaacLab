"""Spin trick environment for the roller-skating Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the roller recipe live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` and are cited as "addendum section N".

The trick is one counter-clockwise turn on the spot: launch, hold about three radians a second,
brake, and rest standing -- four segments on a four-second clock, run five times per twenty-second
episode. The area under that trapezoid is 6.3 rad, which is one turn per cycle to a quarter of a
percent. The phase rides in the three-wide twist slot of the shared 61-wide observation, exactly as
the crouch-glide trick's does.

Structurally this is the crouch-glide task with a different objective, and the two differences that
are not cosmetic are worth stating:

* **The objective is a rate, not a pose.** :attr:`RewardsCfg.spin_rate_track` and
  :attr:`RewardsCfg.spin_rate_l1` score the trunk's yaw rate against the envelope. The rate is read
  in the *body* frame, because that is what the robot's own gyro reports and therefore what the
  policy observes.
* **``angular_momentum`` is dropped, and it is the only task in the batch that drops it.** The term
  charges the norm of the whole angular-momentum vector, so on this task it would fight the
  objective directly. ``body_ang_vel`` survives because it only charges roll and pitch, which damps
  the wobble without touching the rotation (section 10.2).

Everything else is shape. Two shaping terms hint at the mechanism -- a leg scissor and a wheel
differential -- and both are gated by the envelope normalized to ``[0, 1]``, so they fade out with
the rotation and the robot arrives at the standing rest in a neutral station rather than mid-pump.
The scissor is additionally *decayed by curriculum*, which is the only training wheel in the family
that is deliberately removed once it has done its job.

Like the crouch-glide task, this environment is built as a delta on
:class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.velocity.rollers_env_cfg.MicroDuckVelocityRollersFlatEnvCfg`
where upstream rebuilds it from the raw mjlab template; see
:mod:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.rollercrouch.rollercrouch_env_cfg` for why, and for the
wheel-friction interlock the two share.
