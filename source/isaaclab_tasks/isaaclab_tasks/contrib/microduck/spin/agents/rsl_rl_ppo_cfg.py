    Upstream's runner differs from its velocity one in exactly two fields, so the rest is inherited
    rather than restated: the network shapes, the optimizer, the asymmetric actor-critic wiring and
    the 24-step rollout are shared across the whole family.

    Symmetry augmentation is off, and this is one of the two tasks in the batch that gives a correct
    task-level reason for it rather than a stale technical one: a left-right mirror would turn a
    counter-clockwise spin into a clockwise one, which is a different behavior rather than an
    equivalent sample.
