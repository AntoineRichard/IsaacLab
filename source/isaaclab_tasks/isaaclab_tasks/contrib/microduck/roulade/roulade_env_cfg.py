"""Forward-roll ("roulade") environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

The task is a trick, not a skill: the robot starts standing, tips forward over the flat top of its
head, rolls through 360 degrees and lands back on its feet. It is triggered at deployment the way
sit and stand-up are -- the policy switch *is* the trigger, so there is no phase clock, no reference
motion and no command to follow.

Three things make the recipe different from every other MicroDuck task, and the rest follows from
them:

* **The reward is driven by a rotation accumulator, not by the instantaneous state.** Nothing in a
  single frame says how far around the robot has come, so the forward pitch rate is integrated by
  hand into :class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.events.RouladeRollState`, and the landing
  rewards are gated on that integral. The integral only advances while the robot is *supported* and
  while the roll is *sagittal*, which is what stops a ballistic whip or a shoulder roll from
  counting -- both of which upstream's earlier runs discovered and preferred.
* **Nothing may oppose the flip.** There is no fall termination (falling over is the task), no
  always-on upright reward, and the two motion-blocking regularizers the walking recipe shares are
  kept 25 times lighter here or introduced late by curriculum. Upstream established twice that a
  motion tax active during discovery stops the manoeuvre being found at all.
* **Half of every episode starts part-way through the roll.** The mid-roll spawn is a reverse
  curriculum: the second half of a roulade is the face-up recovery problem, which the stand-up task
  already shows is learnable, so those spawns give dense data on the landing while the flip itself
  is still being discovered.

The robot is :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, as the stand-up task's is, and
here the three head shells it adds are what the whole task rests on: they are the surface the robot
pivots on and the only thing the head-ground sensor can report (addendum sections 2.2 and 2.4).

class RewardsCfg:
    """Reward terms for the MDP (addendum section 4.4).

    One dense signal drives the roll and one gated annuity drives the landing:

    * **Progress.** :attr:`roulade_progress` pays increments of the rotation frontier, capped in
      rate. It is potential-based, so a full roll pays a fixed total however it is spread out, and
      the cap makes a violent whip collect *less* than a controlled roll rather than the same amount
      sooner.
    * **The landing annuity.** Six terms are multiplied by a completion gate that only opens past
      260 degrees of supported, sagittal rotation *and* requires the over-the-head latch. They are a
      broad composite, two bootstrap layers under it, a sharp layer above it, a shortfall tax that
      makes crumpling in a heap net negative, and an exit-rise term gated one quadrant earlier.
    * **Straightness.** Three ungated penalties -- out-of-plane rotation, lateral velocity and
      trunk tilt out of the sagittal plane -- give the per-step gradient back toward a clean roll.
      The accumulator's own sagittal gate already makes a shoulder roll unprofitable; these are what
      steer out of one.

    Sign convention: :attr:`roulade_stand_tax` and :attr:`gentle_landing` negate themselves and
    therefore take **positive** weights.

    :attr:`roulade_progress` is declared **first** on purpose: it is the term that advances the
    rotation accumulator, and Isaac Lab evaluates reward terms in declaration order, so every gated
    term below reads the frontier it has just computed.
