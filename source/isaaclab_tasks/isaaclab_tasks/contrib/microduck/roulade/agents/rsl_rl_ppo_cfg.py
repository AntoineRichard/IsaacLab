    Upstream's roll runner differs from its velocity one in three fields, so the rest is inherited
    rather than restated: the network shapes, the optimizer, the asymmetric actor-critic wiring and
    the 24-step rollout are all shared.

    The third field is the interesting one. A forward roll is left-right symmetric, and upstream
    turned the family's symmetry machinery on here -- for the first time -- specifically to fight
    the sideways collapse its earlier runs kept converging to: the policy would roll over a
    shoulder, which is a lower-energy path than going over the head because it avoids the fully
    inverted configuration. The reward set attacks that structurally, through the accumulator's
    sagittal gate and the head-top latch; the mirror loss attacks it in the policy, by penalizing a
    policy that behaves differently on mirrored observations.
