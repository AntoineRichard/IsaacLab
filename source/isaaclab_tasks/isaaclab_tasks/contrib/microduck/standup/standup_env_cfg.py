"""Stand-up environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

The task is the other half of a sit/stand pair. An episode starts the robot on the ground -- face
down, face up, folded into the sitting keyframe a sit policy hands off, or already standing -- and
asks it to reach and hold the standing keyframe. There is no trajectory and no waypoint gating: one
fixed target is rewarded from the first step, and the policy discovers its own rise path.

Two structural differences from :mod:`..velocity` are worth stating up front, because everything
else follows from them:

* The robot is :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, not the walking model. A robot
  that lies on its back and pushes itself up needs a trunk, hips, shins and head that touch the
  floor, and the walking model only has soles.
* The reward set is a **rise** recipe, not a locomotion one: every walking term is gone and the
  weights are upstream's after its 2026-07 division by four, which brought the task mass to about
  12 so the shared sim-to-real regularizers act at the same relative strength as in the
  well-transferring velocity recipe.

    One fixed goal -- the stand pose at :data:`MICRODUCK_STAND_HEIGHT` -- rewarded from the first
    step of every episode, plus the shared sim-to-real regularizers. Three shapes recur and explain
    the apparent duplication:

    * **Two-layer attractors.** ``height_stand`` / ``height_stand_sharp`` and ``upright_linear`` /
      ``upright_sharp`` are the same quantity at a wide and a narrow width. The wide layer is
      already saturated by the time the robot is close, so on its own it leaves no gradient for the
      last centimetre or the last few degrees; the narrow layer supplies exactly that and nothing
      else.
    * **L1 bootstraps.** ``pose_stand_l1`` and ``height_stand_l1`` carry a constant gradient where
      the Gaussians are flat, which is what makes sitting still a net cost rather than a comfortable
      local optimum.
    * **Late-phase penalties.** ``arrival_damping``, ``joint_torque_rate_l2``, ``head_pose_bias``
      and ``body_pose_tracking`` all start at weight zero and are introduced at iteration 2500-3000
      by curricula. Upstream established across two failed runs that any motion tax active during
      the recovery-discovery phase stops the flips being discovered at all -- the fix is timing, not
      magnitude, so the weights below are the *initial* ones and the schedules are load-bearing.

    Sign convention: ``pose_stand_l1``, ``height_stand_l1``, ``gentle_rise`` and ``head_pose_bias``
    negate themselves and therefore take **positive** weights.

    Every weight is upstream's after its 2026-07 division of the whole task stack by four, which
    brought the task mass to about 12 to match the velocity recipe's; upstream's own per-term
    comments quote the pre-division numbers.
