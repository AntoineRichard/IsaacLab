"""Reward terms MicroDuck needs that have no stock Isaac Lab counterpart.

Every term here is ported from ``pollen-robotics/microduck_rl`` and the mjlab velocity template it
builds on; see sections 5 (mjlab kernels) and 6 (MicroDuck's own kernels) of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` for the verbatim upstream formulas. Each function
cites the section it comes from and, where a stock ``isaaclab.envs.mdp`` term covers the same
quantity, why that term could not be reused.

Three families of divergence recur and are worth stating once:

* **Penalties folded into tracking exponents.** Upstream scores the vertical velocity and the
  roll/pitch rate *inside* the velocity-tracking exponents rather than as separate additive terms.
  Inside the exponent a penalty saturates together with the tracking error; added on the outside it
  grows without bound. The stock ``track_lin_vel_xy_exp`` / ``track_ang_vel_z_exp`` therefore are
  not substitutes, however similar they look.
* **Link frame, not centre-of-mass frame.** Upstream reads ``root_link_lin_vel_b`` and
  ``root_link_ang_vel_b``; the stock terms read ``root_lin_vel_b`` / ``root_ang_vel_b``, which
  Isaac Lab measures at the body centre of mass.
* **Sites versus bodies.** Upstream measures foot quantities on MJCF *sites* placed at the soles.
  Isaac Lab has no site concept, so the ports measure the ankle *body* frames instead. The
  functional form is unchanged, but height thresholds are offset by the sole-to-ankle distance and
  need re-tuning rather than copying.

Upstream's diagnostic metrics -- the per-term breakdowns it writes into ``env.extras["log"]``, and
its ``mean_action_acc`` metric term (reference section 2.9) -- are intentionally not ported here:
Isaac Lab's reward manager already logs each term's episode sum, and any further logging belongs
with the task's instrumentation pass rather than inside the reward kernels.

    """Penalize a head-pose error that persists, as opposed to one that averages out.

    Ported from reference section 6 (``head_pose_bias_penalty``). The term holds a per-environment,
    per-joint exponential moving average of the head-pose error with time constant ``tau_s`` and
    returns ``-mean(|ema|)``. It is stateful, so it is a class rather than a function; the state is
    cleared for the environments the reward manager resets.

    The term **negates itself** and is therefore configured with a *positive* weight, matching
    upstream's ``0.0 -> 3.0`` ramp.

    Where upstream clears the average whenever ``episode_length_buf <= 1``, this port clears it from
    :meth:`reset`, which the manager calls with exactly the environments that restarted. The two
    are equivalent and the hook is the Isaac Lab convention.

    An optional **upright gate** suppresses the term while the robot is low or tilted, for the
    recovery tasks whose episodes start on the ground. It multiplies both the error entering the
    average and the returned penalty, so a prone episode accumulates nothing and pays nothing --
    without it the term would tax the head-first phase of a stand-up, which is the motion it needs
    to discover. The velocity task leaves it off.

    violent whip collects strictly *less* total progress reward than a controlled roll rather than
    the same amount sooner.

    This is also the term that advances the accumulator every control step -- see
    :func:`_update_roulade_state`. The other roll terms only read the frontier it leaves behind, so
    it has to be **declared first** among them; Isaac Lab evaluates reward terms in declaration
    order.

        max_paid_rate: Largest rotation rate [rad/s] that is paid for. Rotation faster than this
            forfeits the excess.
        support_sensor_cfg: The contact sensor reporting whether the robot touches the ground, which
            gates the accumulator. It must be filtered against the terrain.

            drives the over-the-head latch.

    lie flat and the swing blade is free to tilt. The stock
    :func:`isaaclab.envs.mdp.flat_orientation_l2` measures the same quantity on the articulation root
    and has no per-body or per-contact gating.

    Leaving the contact gate off asks **both** feet to lie flat at all times, which is what a task
    with no swing phase wants; upstream's roller recipes pass a sensor and its ground-pick recipe
    does not, and that argument is the only difference between the two uses.

    Isaac Lab has no site concept, so this port measures the foot **body** frame and takes the sole
    normal as a parameter. On the converted roller model the ``left_foot`` and ``right_foot`` sites
    are rotated relative to their ankle bodies -- by 180 degrees about ``(0, 1, 1)/sqrt(2)`` on the
    left and by -90 degrees about ``x`` on the right -- and both rotations carry the site ``z`` axis
    onto the ankle body's ``+y`` axis, so ``normal_axis=(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)`` reproduces upstream's
    measurement on both feet. The axis is squared, so its sign is immaterial.

    Note:
        The tilt is NaN-guarded, so a broken environment is charged nothing rather than poisoning the
        batch. A rare solver divergence leaves the body orientations non-finite for a single step,
        and no termination can save the reward for that step: ``ManagerBasedRLEnv.step`` computes
        both the terminations and the rewards from the same post-physics buffers and only *resets*
        the flagged environments afterwards, in ``_reset_idx``. So ``nan_state`` does detect the
        divergence and does recycle the environment, but the reward for the step it happened on is
        computed on the poisoned state either way -- and RSL-RL aborts training on a NaN reward. The

itself on it, so one stack pays for four different things at four points of the same 4 s cycle: bend
the mouth to the floor, hold it there, return to a clean stand, and rest (addendum section 5.5). The
gate is recovered from the command with ``atan2`` rather than read off the command term, which is
