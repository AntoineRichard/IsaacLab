    * ``body_pose`` -- a 6-dimensional trunk-pose delta from the nominal stand, ordered
      ``(x, y, z)`` [m] then ``(roll, pitch, yaw)`` [rad].

    debug visualization on purpose: an environment holds several of these and none of them tracks
    an error the command term itself could measure -- the reward terms do that.

    The ranges are read on every resample rather than cached, so a curriculum can widen them by
    reassigning :attr:`UniformPoseDeltaCommandCfg.ranges` on the live term configuration. Widening
    only: the command width is fixed at construction, and a resample asserts that the replacement

    * **forward-only** (:attr:`MicroDuckVelocityCommandCfg.rel_forward_envs`) -- the surge command
      is rectified and floored, ``vx = |vx|.clamp(min=0.3)`` [m/s], with sway and yaw rate zeroed.
      This is upstream's base-template behaviour, which MicroDuck inherits.
    * **turn-in-place** (:attr:`MicroDuckVelocityCommandCfg.rel_turn_in_place_envs`) -- the linear

      uniform sampling almost never produces "no translation, large rotation", so spinning on the

    The buckets are independent draws, not a partition, so an environment can fall in several of
    them. Upstream resolves the overlap by ordering, and this term reproduces it exactly:
    turn-in-place beats standing beats forward-only. Forward-only rewrites the command in place;
    standing is a flag the base class re-zeroes the command from on every step, which overrides a
    forward-only value; and turn-in-place is applied last and clears the standing flag for its
    environments, so it survives both.

    Two things change relative to :class:`MicroDuckVelocityCommand`:

    * a **target heading** in the world frame is drawn uniformly on every resample, and the yaw slot
      of the command is filled every step with the wrapped error between it and the robot's current
      heading, clamped to the configured yaw range. The stock heading controller cannot express this:
      it multiplies the error by a stiffness to produce a yaw *rate*, and it only drives the fraction
      of environments in its heading bucket;
    * the surge slot is a **throttle**, not a velocity target -- ``0`` coasts, positive pushes,
      negative brakes -- which is what the roller reward set reads it as.

    On the shipped configuration the yaw range is ``(0.0, 0.0)``, so the heading error is computed
    and then clamped away and the yaw slot is identically zero (addendum section 7.21): heading is
    disabled while upstream focuses on straight-line skating, and
    :class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.rewards.heading_hold_reward` is what keeps the
    robot straight instead. The machinery is carried across anyway, because it is what re-enabling
    turning consists of.

    Note:
        Upstream's override *replaces* the base ``_update_command`` and therefore drops its
        standing-environment zeroing. That is inert at ``rel_standing_envs = 0.0``, which is what the
        roller task ships, so this port keeps the zeroing and stays correct if the fraction is ever

class SitStandCommand(UniformVelocityCommand):
    """Posture flag riding in the twist slot: ``[sit_flag, 0, 0]``, ``sit_flag`` in ``{0, 1}``.

    Ported from addendum section 4.3 (``SitStandCommand``). The sit-stand task has no velocity to
    track, so its three-wide command slot carries a binary posture request instead -- 0 asks for the
    stand keyframe, 1 for the sitting one -- and the slot keeps its width because the deployed
    61-wide observation is shared across the whole MicroDuck policy family. On the robot a button
    press writes 0 or 1 into that column.

    Two quantities and the distinction between them is the whole design:

    * :attr:`command` is the **raw flag**, and it is what the policy observes. A deployed runtime
      flips it instantly, so that is what the policy has to be trained on.
    * :attr:`alpha` is a **slewed blend** of the same request, moving toward the flag at a constant
      ``1 / ramp_s`` per second, and it is what the posture rewards track. This is the task's
      anti-crash mechanism. Against the raw flag, arriving early collects the full goal-state
      payout for every step saved while the speed caps only integrate to a bounded excess-distance
      cost -- upstream measured an instant drop beating a one-second descent by about sevenfold.
      Against the moving blend, being *ahead* of the ramp scores about zero on the height and
      composite stack, so tracking the slow setpoint is the argmax and the caps are left as
      backstops for overshoot.

    The resample draws a fresh flag with probability :attr:`SitStandCommandCfg.sit_prob`, on the
    configured dwell time. Combined with a reset that spawns seated or standing with equal
    probability, the four (start state x request) combinations get equal coverage, which is what
    trains "hold what you are already doing" alongside the two transitions.

    Note:
        Upstream re-initializes the blend from the robot's actual trunk height inside ``compute``,
        guarded on ``episode_length_buf <= 1``, and its own comment explains that this is a
        workaround: its command manager resets *before* the event that teleports the robot into its
        spawn pose, so a reset hook would read the pre-teleport height and drag a seated spawn
        upward. Isaac Lab fires reset-mode events before it resets the command manager, so this port
        does the same re-initialization from :meth:`reset` -- the hook the manager calls with exactly
        the environments that restarted, and by then the spawn pose is already written.
