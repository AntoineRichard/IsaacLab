"""Observation terms modelling the sensor imperfections MicroDuck trains against.

The policy deployed on the robot reads servo encoders and an IMU over a bus, so upstream corrupts
the actor observations in three systematic ways that per-step noise cannot express: a constant
per-robot encoder bias, a constant per-robot IMU mounting misalignment, and a stochastic bus
latency. The critic keeps the true values -- it is privileged -- plus a few sensor-derived terms
that are guarded against non-finite reads.

Every term is ported from ``pollen-robotics/microduck_rl``; the upstream sources are quoted in
sections 2.3, 5, 6 and 8 of ``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md``.

Observation delay.
"""


class delayed_observation(ManagerTermBase):
    """Wraps another observation term in the stochastic bus latency upstream models.

    The value the policy reads on the robot is between zero and a few control periods old,
    depending on when the sample landed relative to the control tick. Upstream expresses this as a
    per-environment integer lag re-drawn on a slow cadence, so that a lag persists over many steps
    instead of flickering every step -- a policy can filter out flicker, but not a latency regime
    (reference section 8). MicroDuck uses two settings:

    * ``base_ang_vel`` and ``projected_gravity``: ``min_lag=0``, ``max_lag=1``,
      ``update_period=64`` -- a 0 or 20 ms latency that switches at most every 64 control steps;
    * ``joint_vel``: ``min_lag=1``, ``max_lag=1``, ``update_period=0`` -- a constant 20 ms lag,
      because the servo firmware derives velocity from the previous position-sample window.

    The lag update follows upstream exactly (reference section 8):

    #. the newest sample is pushed first, so lag 0 is the current value;
    #. with ``update_period = N > 0`` a lag is re-drawn only when ``(step + phase) % N == 0``,
       where ``phase`` is a per-environment offset drawn at construction and again on reset, which
       staggers the environments instead of switching them all on the same step;
    #. ``hold_prob`` further suppresses a re-draw, giving temporally correlated latency; upstream
       leaves it at 0.0;
    #. a lag is clamped to the frames actually buffered, so a freshly reset environment gets the
       newest frame rather than a stale one from before the reset;
    #. the buffer advances exactly once per control step, however often the observation manager
       recomputes the group within that step -- the term memoizes its output against the
       environment's ``common_step_counter``, and advances on every call for an environment that
       has none.

    Rule 5 is why a reset does not clear the history immediately. An environment that computes a
    final observation before resetting part of the batch calls the term twice within one control
    step with a reset in between; clearing the history there and refilling it on the second call
    would advance the buffer twice, and every environment that was *not* reset would silently skip
    a frame. The clear is therefore deferred to the next advance, and the second call serves the
    reset environments the fresh value -- which is what they would read anyway, having no history
    left to be delayed by -- while the rest keep the frame they were already served.

    One deviation from upstream's pipeline: mjlab orders it compute, noise, then delay, so the
    stale frame carries the noise sample it was drawn with; here the term wraps the *compute*
    stage, so Isaac Lab's noise is applied fresh to the stale frame. Both give a stale signal plus
    an independent uniform draw, so the observation distribution is the same; only the particular
    noise sample attached to a repeated frame differs.

    Isaac Lab's :class:`~isaaclab.utils.buffers.DelayBuffer` resamples its lag only on reset and
    has no ``update_period``, phase or hold concept, so this term keeps its own lag state over the
    same :class:`~isaaclab.utils.buffers.CircularBuffer` that ``DelayBuffer`` wraps. Doing the lag
    bookkeeping here also keeps it free of the host-device synchronization
    :meth:`~isaaclab.utils.buffers.DelayBuffer.set_time_lag` performs on every call.

    ``per_env`` and ``per_env_phase`` are not exposed: upstream leaves both at their per-environment
    defaults, and a shared lag would defeat the point of the term.

    Never hoist an :class:`~isaaclab.managers.ObservationTermCfg` wrapping this term to module
    level and reuse the same instance across two observation slots (for example the actor's
    ``base_ang_vel`` and ``projected_gravity``): the manager keys its term instance -- and this
    term's lag state and :class:`~isaaclab.utils.buffers.CircularBuffer` -- off the cfg object's
    identity, so sharing one cfg instance aliases the delay buffer between the two slots instead
    of giving each its own. Construct a distinct cfg per slot.

    the closest, :func:`isaaclab.envs.mdp.object_pos_in_robot_root_frame`, resolves the robot through

    The rotation is the full base orientation rather than a yaw-only one, as upstream's is, so a

    swap it for a perception term later without reshaping anything else.

    The read is guarded against non-finite values where upstream's is not. No MicroDuck task

    ejected would otherwise reach the learner through this term and nothing else.
