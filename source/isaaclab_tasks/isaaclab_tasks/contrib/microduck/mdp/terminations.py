    """Terminate environments whose robot state has stopped being finite.

    Ported from reference section 6 (``robot_state_is_nan``). A solver that diverges leaves NaN or
    infinite values in the state, which then propagate into the observations and poison the policy
    gradient for the whole batch; terminating resets the environment instead. Despite its name the
    check is for non-finiteness, so infinities are caught as well.

    This is not a time-out: configure it with ``time_out=False`` so the value bootstraps as a real
    failure.

    There is no stock counterpart. :func:`isaaclab.envs.mdp.root_height_below_minimum` and
    :func:`~isaaclab.envs.mdp.bad_orientation` catch a fallen robot, not a broken one, and a NaN
    height compares false against every bound rather than tripping them.

            does not carry are ignored, as upstream does. Defaults to an empty tuple.

    """Terminate an environment whose robot has been continuously down for too long.

    Ported from addendum section 3.5 (``fallen_too_long``). It is the backstop of the hybrid
    walking-and-recovery task: once the tilt termination is disabled by curriculum a fall no longer
    ends the episode, and without this term a robot that never gets up would spend the remaining
    eighteen seconds of its episode on the floor, filling the rollout with data about lying down.

    Two properties are deliberate and both differ from the recovery *rewards*:

    * The gate is **height or tilt**, where the rewards gate on tilt alone. That asymmetry is
      upstream's: a robot sitting low but upright is not paid as fallen, but it is recycled as
      stuck, so sitting is neither rewarded nor a comfortable place to wait.
    * The clock measures a **continuous** fall. Getting up at any point clears it, so a robot that
      falls repeatedly is not accumulating a budget across recoveries.

    This is not a time-out: configure it with ``time_out=False`` so the value bootstraps as a real
    failure, which is what makes lying down expensive to the critic.

    Being a clock the term is stateful, so it is a class.
