    r"""Joint position action that compensates the joint-encoder calibration error.

    The servo closes its position loop on the encoder reading, so a command of :math:`q^*` parks
    the joint at :math:`q^* - b`, where :math:`b` is the encoder bias
    (:func:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.events.encoder_bias`). Upstream reproduces this by
    subtracting the bias from the target (reference section 3):

    .. math::

        \text{target} = \text{default} + \text{scale} \times \text{action} - \text{bias}

    This is the action-side half of the encoder-bias randomization, and it only makes sense
    together with the observation-side half,
    :func:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.observations.joint_pos_rel_biased`: the actor sees
    ``joint_pos + bias`` and the target subtracts ``bias``, so a policy commanding ``a`` reads back
    ``a`` while the true joint settles at ``default + a - bias``. What the bias then perturbs is
    the *robot*, not the policy's frame of reference -- the joints of a leg no longer agree on
    where zero is, which is exactly the calibration error the term models. Using only one half
    instead trains a policy against a permanent offset in its own commands.

    Both halves read the same tensor, so a task must give this term and the biased observation the
    same asset.

    .. note::
        Reference section 3 states that outcome the other way round -- true joint at ``HOME + a``,
        reading ``HOME + a + bias``. The simulator carries no bias of its own, so it tracks the
        target it is handed: the joint settles on ``default + a - bias`` and the biased observation
        reports ``q + bias = default + a``. The formulas quoted in that section are right; the one
        sentence of prose after them is not.
