"""Staged curriculum terms for the MicroDuck tasks.

Every term here is a **step function over the global environment-step count**: a stage table lists
``{"step": ..., <payload>: ...}`` entries and the term applies the payload of the last stage whose
boundary the run has passed. Nothing is interpolated, exactly as upstream (reference section 6).

The stock :class:`isaaclab.envs.mdp.modify_reward_weight` is not reusable for the weight ramps: it
carries a *single* ``(num_steps, weight)`` pair, so upstream's six-stage ``action_rate_l2`` ramp
would need six curriculum terms racing to write the same reward weight, in an order the manager
does not guarantee. :func:`reward_weight_stages` keeps the whole schedule in one term, which is
also how it is written upstream.

.. note::
    Upstream compares the step counter with ``>`` in its weight, standing-fraction and
    centre-of-mass curricula but with ``>=`` in its pose-range curriculum
    (``microduck_rl/.../mdp.py:5512-5541`` versus ``:3295``, ``:3442``, ``:3464``). That
    inconsistency is reproduced verbatim rather than smoothed over, so a stage table transcribed
    from upstream schedules identically here. It is only observable on the single environment step
    that coincides with a stage boundary, because every MicroDuck stage table restates the
    configured value in its first stage.
