    """The per-environment, per-joint encoder bias [rad] of an articulation.

    The bias models a joint-encoder calibration error: a constant offset between the joint position
    the servo reports and the one the simulation holds. It is a single quantity read by three
    parties, so it cannot live in any one of them:

    * :func:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.observations.joint_pos_rel_biased` **adds** it,
      because that is what the encoders report to the policy;
    * :class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.actions.BiasedJointPositionAction`
      **subtracts** it, because the servo closes its position loop on the same biased reading;
    * :func:`randomize_encoder_bias` samples it.

    Upstream stores the tensor on the articulation itself (``asset.data.encoder_bias``, reference
    section 5); Isaac Lab's articulation data has no such field, so it is cached on the environment
    instead, keyed by asset name. The tensor is allocated on first use and only ever written
    in place, so a reader may resolve it at any time -- including before the startup randomization
    runs, which is when the observation manager first probes the observation dimensions.

    A task that never wires :func:`randomize_encoder_bias` therefore reads an all-zero bias, and
    the biased terms degenerate to their unbiased counterparts.

    """Reset an articulation into a named ground pose: face-down, face-up, sitting, standing or crouching.

    Ported from addendum section 3.4 (``set_random_ground_state``). This single event *is* the
    stand-up task's episode distribution: which pose an episode starts from decides which skill it
    exercises, and a curriculum ramps the four probabilities from the easy mix (mostly standing and
    sitting) to the hard one (mostly prone) as the run progresses. There is no stock counterpart --
    :func:`isaaclab.envs.mdp.reset_root_state_uniform` samples one continuous band, not a mixture of
    named keyframes with a matching joint pose.

    The five buckets:

    * **face-down** -- the trunk pitched +90 degrees, belly to the floor, at a random yaw.
    * **face-up** -- pitched -90 degrees, back to the floor, then rolled by up to
      :attr:`face_up_roll_max` about the body's long axis. That partial roll is a reverse
      curriculum: recovering from flat on the back has no reward gradient until the roll completes,
      so some episodes start part-way along it.
    * **sitting** -- upright within :attr:`sitting_tilt_max`, low, with the legs folded into
      :attr:`sitting_joint_pos`. This is the hand-off pose a sit policy leaves the robot in, so it
      is sampled with joint noise rather than exactly: a policy trained on the exact keyframe does
      not survive the real hand-off.
    * **standing** -- the same orientation sampler as sitting but at standing height and with the
      joints left at the stand pose, so the policy also learns to *hold* a stand.
    * **crouching** -- a *continuum* rather than a keyframe (addendum section 3.4,
      ``set_random_crouch_state``). One depth draw per environment leans the trunk forward, lowers
      it and folds the legs toward :attr:`crouch_joint_pos` together, so the bucket seeds resets
      **across** the crouch-to-stand stretch rather than at one point on it. That stretch is the
      last mile of a recovery, and a task that only reaches it at the tail of a rare good rollout
      collects almost no data there -- upstream added the bucket after measuring policies that
      recovered as far as the crouch and parked.

    The probabilities are normalized and need not sum to one. Only the sitting and crouching buckets
    touch the joints; the other three keep whatever the joint reset wrote.

    This term overwrites the root height and orientation, so it must run **after** any root reset it
    shares an episode with, and that reset's horizontal spread is what survives. Isaac Lab fires
    reset events in configuration declaration order.

    Args:
        env: The environment holding the articulation.
        env_ids: The environments to reset. Defaults to None, which resets all of them.
        face_down_prob: Relative probability of the face-down bucket.
        face_up_prob: Relative probability of the face-up bucket.
        sitting_prob: Relative probability of the sitting bucket.
        standing_prob: Relative probability of the standing bucket.
        crouch_prob: Relative probability of the crouching bucket. Defaults to 0.0, which is what
            the tasks with a fixed set of keyframes want.
        prone_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the two prone buckets spawn in, above the environment
            origin. Defaults to None, which is only allowed when both prone buckets are disabled.
        sitting_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the sitting bucket spawns in. Defaults to None, which
            is only allowed when that bucket is disabled.
        standing_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the standing bucket spawns in. Defaults to None,
            which is only allowed when that bucket is disabled.
        crouch_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the crouching bucket **interpolates across**, ordered
            ``(deepest, standing)``. Unlike the other three this is not sampled independently: the
            same depth draw that folds the legs picks the height, so the pose stays self-consistent.
            Defaults to None, which is only allowed when that bucket is disabled.
        sitting_joint_pos: Joint name to angle [rad] the sitting bucket folds its legs into. Joints
            left out of it stay at the stand pose, which is how the neck and head are handled.
            Defaults to None, which is only allowed when that bucket is disabled.
        sitting_joint_noise_std: Standard deviation [rad] of the zero-mean **Gaussian** noise added
            to *every* joint selected by :attr:`asset_cfg` in the sitting bucket, on top of the
            overrides. Defaults to 0.0, which writes the keyframe exactly.
        sitting_tilt_max: Bound [rad] on the uniform pitch and roll the sitting and standing buckets
            are tilted by. Defaults to 0.0, which spawns them exactly upright.
        face_up_roll_max: Bound [rad] on the uniform roll about the body long axis applied to the
            face-up bucket. Defaults to 0.0, which spawns it flat on its back.
        crouch_joint_pos: Joint name to angle [rad] of the *deepest* crouch, which the crouching
            bucket lerps toward by its depth draw. Defaults to None, which is only allowed when that
            bucket is disabled.
        crouch_depth_range: Bounds [-] on the per-environment depth draw, 0 being the stand pose and
            1 being :attr:`crouch_joint_pos` at the bottom of :attr:`crouch_z_range`. Defaults to
            ``(0.0, 1.0)``, the whole stretch.
        crouch_pitch_max: Forward trunk lean [rad] at full depth, before the fixed jitter and floor.
            Defaults to 0.0, which leaves only the jitter.
        crouch_joint_noise: Half-width [rad] of the zero-mean **uniform** noise added to every joint
            selected by :attr:`asset_cfg` in the crouching bucket, on top of the lerp. Upstream uses
            a uniform draw here and a Gaussian one for the sitting bucket; both are reproduced.
            Defaults to 0.0.
        asset_cfg: The articulation to reset, and the joints the sitting and crouching noise reach.
            Selecting them by name reproduces upstream's exclusion of passive joints, which are not
            part of any keyframe.

    """Per-environment bookkeeping of the forward roll, shared by the roll's rewards and its reset.

    Ported from addendum section 4.3, where it lives as five loose attributes on the environment
    (``_roulade_accum``, ``_roulade_max``, ``_roulade_paid``, ``_roulade_head_latch`` and
    ``_roulade_last_update_step``). The roll is a *stateful* task: nothing in the instantaneous
    physics says how far around the robot has come, so the rotation is integrated by hand and the
    completion gates read the integral rather than a clock. Every consumer therefore has to agree on
    one object, which is why it is stored on the environment rather than inside a term.

    The four buffers mean different things and all four are load-bearing:

    * :attr:`accumulated_angle` is the running integral. It can go **down**, because rocking
      backwards integrates a negative rate, and it is what the head latch and the head-pivot reward
      window are measured against.
    * :attr:`frontier` is the maximum of that integral so far, which is what the completion gates
      read: backward rocking may not un-open a gate the robot has already earned.
    * :attr:`paid` is the part of the frontier :func:`~..rewards.roulade_progress` has already paid
      out, so the reward is an increment rather than a level.
    * :attr:`head_latch` records that the robot went over the flat top of its head, which the
      landing rewards require.

    :attr:`last_update_step` is the step guard: several rewards read the state in one control step
    and the integral must advance exactly once.

    """Reset an articulation into a standing start or part-way through a forward roll.

    Ported from addendum section 4.5 (``reset_roulade_state``). The two buckets are the roll task's
    whole episode distribution, and the mid-roll one is a **reverse curriculum**: the second half of
    a forward roll -- supine, then sitting up, then standing -- is the face-up recovery problem the
    stand-up task already proves is learnable, so spawning into it gives the policy dense data on
    the part of the trick a standing start only reaches after it has already solved the flip.

    * **standing** -- upright within :attr:`standing_tilt_max`, at a random yaw, at standing height,
      with the joints left wherever the joint reset put them. :attr:`forward_vel_range` is
      upstream's "élan" hook: a forward base velocity that would let the roll be entered out of a
      walk. The roll task ships it at ``(0.0, 0.0)``, so the branch never runs.
    * **mid-roll** -- pitched :attr:`midroll_pitch_range` into the roll (90 degrees is balanced on
      the head, 180 on the back, 340 seated and leaning back), low, with the legs and the neck
      lerped toward :attr:`tuck_joint_pos` by a per-environment factor, and with optional forward
      angular momentum.

    This term also **writes the roll bookkeeping** :func:`roulade_roll_state`, and the two halves of
    that are as load-bearing as the pose (addendum section 4.5):

    * A mid-roll spawn has its rotation accumulator, frontier and paid pointer all pre-set to the
      **spawn pitch**, so a 170-degree spawn is only paid for the remaining 190 degrees and the
      completion gates stay consistent with how far around the robot actually is.
    * A mid-roll spawn is **granted the head latch**, because it never had the chance to earn one;
      requiring it would keep the landing gate shut for the whole bucket. A standing spawn starts at
      zero and must earn the latch by rolling over its head.

    The probabilities are normalized and need not sum to one. Only the mid-roll bucket touches the
    joints.

    This term overwrites the root height, orientation and velocity, so it must run **after** any
    root reset it shares an episode with, and **after** the joint reset whose pose the tuck lerps
    from. Isaac Lab fires reset events in configuration declaration order.

    Args:
        env: The environment holding the articulation.

        standing_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the standing bucket spawns in, above the environment
            origin.
        midroll_z_range: Trunk height band [m] the mid-roll bucket spawns in.
        midroll_pitch_range: Bounds [rad] on how far into the roll the mid-roll bucket spawns.
        standing_tilt_max: Bound [rad] on the uniform pitch the standing bucket is tilted by.
            Defaults to 0.0, which spawns it exactly upright. The roll is sampled independently and
            is at least 5 degrees wide, as upstream's is.
        forward_vel_range: Bounds [m/s] on the forward base velocity given to standing spawns.
            Defaults to ``(0.0, 0.0)``, which is a standstill start and skips the branch.
        midroll_omega_range: Bounds [rad/s] on the forward roll rate given to mid-roll spawns.
            Defaults to ``(0.0, 0.0)``, which skips the branch.
        tuck_joint_pos: Joint name to angle [rad] the mid-roll bucket lerps its legs and neck
            toward. Defaults to None, which leaves the joints at the pose the joint reset wrote.
        tuck_factor_range: Bounds [-] on the per-environment lerp factor from the reset pose toward
            :attr:`tuck_joint_pos`. Defaults to ``(0.3, 1.0)``, so the tuck is never fully absent.
        joint_noise_std: Standard deviation [rad] of the zero-mean noise added to every joint
            selected by :attr:`asset_cfg` in the mid-roll bucket, on top of the tuck. Defaults to
            0.0.
        asset_cfg: The articulation to reset, and the joints the tuck noise reaches. Selecting them

    Ported from addendum section 5.6 (``apply_mouth_payload_force``). The payload is not an asset:
    it is an equivalent wrench, a 10-40 g point mass at the mouth tip, and at the end of a head on
    the end of a neck it is a real moment about the ankles during the return. Its gate ramps in over
    ``ramp`` of a cycle from ``hold_end`` -- the moment the mouth closes on the object -- and stays
    on for the rest of the cycle, dropping abruptly at the wrap.

    Note:
        Upstream implements this as a **weight-zero reward term** whose function writes an external
        wrench every step (addendum section 13.20). This port registers it where Isaac Lab writes
        state -- as an interval event on a zero-width interval, so it fires every control step for
        every environment -- because a zero-weight reward that is load-bearing physics is exactly the
        thing a later cleanup deletes. The consequence is that the wrench is written after the
        command manager advances the clock rather than before, so it lags upstream by one control
        step out of the 200 in a cycle.
