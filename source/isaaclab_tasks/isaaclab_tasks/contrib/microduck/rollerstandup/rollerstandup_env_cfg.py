"""Stand-up environment for the roller-skating Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the roller recipe live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks2.md`` and are cited as "addendum section N".

This is the stand-up recipe on skates: an episode starts the robot face down, face up or already
standing, and asks it to reach and hold the standing station within six seconds. There is no
trajectory and no waypoint gating -- one fixed target is rewarded from the first step, and the policy
discovers its own rise path, exactly as on
:mod:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.standup.standup_env_cfg`.

What the wheels change is the *bootstrap*. A rolling contact has no longitudinal grip, so a robot on
skates has nothing to push against, and upstream's answer is a wheel-friction curriculum that runs
**backwards**: it starts with the bearings almost locked -- which makes them behave like feet -- and
relaxes them over four thousand iterations toward the physics of a real bearing. That has a
deployment consequence, stated in :attr:`CurriculumCfg.wheel_friction` and worth repeating here:
**only checkpoints from after the last stage are candidates for the robot.**

.. warning::

    Upstream's version of this environment **cannot run at the pinned commit**. Three of its reward
    terms index a fourteen-wide servo view with indices drawn from the eighteen-joint model layout,
    which raises ``IndexError`` on the first reward evaluation (section 13.2, upstream issue draft
    016). The port therefore diverges to function: every joint selection here is resolved **by name**,
    which is what the rest of this package does anyway and what makes the interleaved wheel hinges a
    non-issue. Because upstream cannot be run, this task has **no accuracy gate against it**; what
    stands in its place is an internal acceptance test that evaluates the task's own reward from a
    fallen-on-skates start under physics (``test_microduck_rollerstandup_env.py``).

    Nineteen terms: eight regularizers carried over from the skating recipe, and the eleven-term
    rise stack that replaces everything else.

    **What the skating recipe loses, and why.** ``feet_flat`` goes because the blades are *not* flat
    during a rise and the term would fight the gesture; ``hip_roll_neutral`` because standing up
    needs the legs spread; ``pose`` and ``com_height_target`` because the rise stack supplies its own
    pose and height targets; ``upright`` because :attr:`upright_linear` and :attr:`upright_sharp`
    replace it; and the whole stroke -- wheel speed, braking, air time, glide, single support, gait
    symmetry, forward lean and heading hold -- because there is no stroke.

    **Three shapes recur in what replaces it**, and they are the wheel-less stand-up task's:

    * **Two-layer attractors.** :attr:`height_stand` / :attr:`height_stand_sharp` and
      :attr:`upright_linear` / :attr:`upright_sharp` are the same quantity at a wide and a narrow
      width. The wide layer is saturated by the time the robot is close and leaves no gradient for
      the last centimetre; the narrow layer supplies exactly that.
    * **L1 bootstraps.** :attr:`pose_stand_l1` and :attr:`height_stand_l1` carry a constant gradient
      where the Gaussians are flat, which is what makes lying still a net cost rather than a
      comfortable local optimum.
    * **A composite goal.** :attr:`standing_composite` is the product of the height, upright and pose
      scores, so it pays only when all three are right at once -- and at weight 15.0 it is the
      largest single term in the task.

    Sign convention: :attr:`pose_stand_l1`, :attr:`height_stand_l1` and :attr:`gentle_rise` negate
    themselves and therefore take **positive** weights. :attr:`gentle_rise` is the one worth
    checking twice -- upstream inherited it at ``-0.02`` from the wheel-less task, measured it
    *rewarding* vertical acceleration, and fixed the sign here; its own comment calls it the cause of
    a "very violent" rise and explains the failed damping attempts it had produced (section 9.6).

    # starts almost locked and is relaxed toward the same 0.0015 the skating task converges on, and

    # to push against, and the gesture is bootstrapped on a nearly-footed problem before the real
    # rolling physics is imposed.

    # Two consequences upstream flags and this port carries:
    #
    # * **Deployment gate.** Only checkpoints from after the last stage -- iteration 4000 and later --
    #   are candidates for the robot. Before that the policy is leaning on a rolling friction the
    #   hardware does not have.
    # * **Diagnostic.** If ``standing_composite`` collapses at one of the stage boundaries, the
    #   "sticky feet" technique has not transferred to free wheels and a skater's technique has to be
    #   guided instead.
