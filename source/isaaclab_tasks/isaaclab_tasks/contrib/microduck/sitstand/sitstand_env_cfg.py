"""Sit-stand environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

One policy, both directions. A binary posture request arrives in the twist slot of the deployed
observation -- 0 asks the robot to stand, 1 asks it to sit -- and flips every few seconds, so a
single episode trains a descent, a seated rest, a rise and a standing rest. Reset draws the starting
posture independently of the first request, which is what also trains "hold what you are already
doing" in both postures.

There is no trajectory, no waypoint and no phase clock: the policy discovers its own transition path,
in as many steps as it likes, and may use its head as a third support point on the way. What replaces
all of that is the :class:`~isaaclab_tasks.contrib.microduck.mdp.commands.SitStandCommand`'s
**slewed target**. Every posture reward tracks a blend that moves toward the requested flag at a
fixed rate over :data:`MICRODUCK_POSTURE_RAMP_S`, while the policy observes the raw flag. Upstream
established the difference across two runs: against the raw flag, dropping instantly collects the
whole goal-state payout for every step saved and beats a one-second descent by about sevenfold, so
the trained policy crash-sat. Against the moving blend, being *ahead* of the ramp scores near zero on
the height and composite stack, and the speed caps below are backstops for overshoot rather than the
gentleness mechanism.

Three things follow from the task rather than from the recipe:

* The robot is :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_ALLCOLLISIONS_CFG`, not the walking model. The
  seated pose rests the trunk and the folded legs on the floor, and the walking model has colliders
  only on the two soles.
* There is **no fall termination**. A wobble or a tip during a transition has to play out so the
  policy pays the impact and uprightness costs rather than having the episode truncated under it.
* Five terms carry **positive weights on self-negating kernels**. See :class:`RewardsCfg`; upstream
  records a full run lost to getting those signs wrong.

    """Reward terms for the MDP (addendum sections 4.4 and 4.5).

    Every task term reads the commanded posture and selects its target from it, so one stack rewards
    both rest states and both transitions. The shapes recur and explain the apparent duplication:

    * **Two-layer attractors.** ``posture_height`` and ``posture_height_sharp`` are the same quantity
      at a wide and a narrow width; the wide layer saturates well before the robot has arrived, and
      the narrow one supplies the last few millimetres of gradient.
    * **L1 drivers.** ``posture_pose_l1`` and ``posture_height_l1`` carry a constant gradient where
      the Gaussians are flat, which is what makes resting in the *wrong* posture net-negative in both
      directions rather than merely unrewarded.
    * **Multiplicative goal.** ``posture_composite`` scores height, tilt, pose and head as a product,
      so the partial-sum compromises the rest of the stack invites -- plank, flop, lean, park a
      centimetre short -- collapse to nothing.

    **Sign convention.** ``posture_pose_l1``, ``posture_height_l1``, ``descent_speed``,
    ``rise_speed`` and ``gentle_motion`` all return values that are already negative, and therefore
    take **positive** weights. Upstream lost a full run to getting this wrong: at negative weights
    the double negative turned the three speed and shock penalties into the three largest *rewards*
    in the stack and trained a butt-hopping, crash-sitting policy. After any change here, the check
    is that each penalty's logged episode sum stays at or below zero.
