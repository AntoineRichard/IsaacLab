"""Ball-kick environment for the Pollen Robotics MicroDuck biped.

Ported from `pollen-robotics/microduck_rl <https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl>`_,
which trains MicroDuck on mjlab. Every value taken from upstream cites a section of
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference_tasks3.md``, the extraction of the pinned upstream
checkouts; the sections that describe the shared mjlab base template live in the companion
``artifacts/microduck/upstream_reference.md`` and are cited as "reference section N".

The robot starts standing at a random heading with a ball on the ground just in front of one foot,
and has five seconds to kick it away at about a walking pace and stay on its feet. There is no
command, no phase clock and no curriculum on the kick itself: the kick reward is live from the first
step and an earlier kick collects more rolling reward, so the policy kicks immediately.

Three things make this task structurally unlike the rest of the family:

* **It is the only two-entity environment.** The scene carries
  :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_BALL_CFG` next to the robot, and a reset event places the ball in
  the robot's own yaw frame after the robot's pose is settled. That event ordering is behaviour, not
  housekeeping -- see :class:`EventsCfg`.
* **The actor is blind to the ball.** The deployed robot has no ball sensing, so the ball reaches
  the critic only and the actor keeps the family's 61-wide deploy contract byte for byte. The policy
  learns to kick from proprioception and from where the ball reliably *is* at reset.
* **The task is one-footed on purpose.** ``KICK_FOOT`` picks the swinging foot and the other one is
  rewarded for staying planted, which is why left-right symmetry is off here where the forward-roll
  task turns it on.

    (0.25 m/s -- a gentle tap)", says "Weight 12.0 = 3.0/target so the at-target payoff stays
    approximately +3/step", and says the net reward "only hits 0 at ~1.0 m/s, 4x the target". All
    three statements are consistent with a target of 0.25 and none of them with the 1.0 the file
    actually sets (``:95``); the target was raised and the weights were not rescaled, which
    ``:90-94`` explicitly warns against ("if you change the target, rescale the weights with it").

    At the shipped constants the kick pays ``12 * min(v, 1.0) - 4 * max(v - 1.0, 0)``: **+12/step**
    at target, zero at 4.0 m/s and a floor of -8/step past 6.0 m/s. That is four times the intended
    at-target payoff and roughly doubles the task's reward mass, so the shared regularizers act at
    about half their intended relative strength while the ball rolls.

    The code is reproduced rather than the prose, because the shipped weights are what upstream's
    runs were trained against; the discrepancy is reported upstream separately. Rescaling
    :attr:`RewardsCfg.ball_forward_velocity` to 3.0 and
