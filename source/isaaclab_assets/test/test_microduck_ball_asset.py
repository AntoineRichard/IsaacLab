"""Fidelity tests for the MicroDuck ball prop, the one non-robot asset of the MicroDuck family.

Unlike the three robot models, :data:`~isaaclab_assets.MICRODUCK_BALL_CFG` is **authored** rather
than converted: its upstream source is a 15-line MJCF holding a single analytic sphere, so there is
nothing for the mesh importer to carry. That makes the fidelity question a different one -- not "did
the conversion survive" but "does the configuration reproduce the MJCF" -- and the reference is the
MJCF itself, compiled by MuJoCo, exactly as it is for the robots.

Two properties carry the physics and neither follows from the geometry:

* the **hollow-shell** inertia ``(2/3) m r^2``, which is 40 % larger than the solid-sphere tensor a
  sphere prim with only a mass resolves to, and which decides how a kicked ball trades rolling for
  sliding;
* the **friction actually bound to the collider**, which the MicroDuck conversion had to repair by
  hand on the robots and which a prop authored through a spawner gets from a different path.

The MJCF is fetched from the pinned upstream commit into a local cache; the tests skip when it is
unavailable. Point ``MICRODUCK_MJCF_DIR`` at a directory holding the upstream MJCFs to use a local
copy instead.
